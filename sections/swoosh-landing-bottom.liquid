    <div class="faq-list">
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How long until I see results? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Pretty much instantly for prevention - no new rings will form after you clip it in. Already have some gnarly buildup? Those stains start fading within 1-2 weeks as the formula breaks them down flush by flush. Most people see a completely transformed bowl within 30 days. Pro tip: start with a clean bowl for the fastest results.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Will I seriously never have to scrub again? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">We know, sounds too good to be true. But here's the deal: TrueClean cuts scrubbing by about 80%. Most customers go from cleaning twice a week to maybe once every 3 months (if that). You'll still want to do a quick wipe of the outside and under the seat - but the days of getting on your knees to attack mineral rings? Yeah, those are over.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is it safe for my toilet and plumbing? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Absolutely. This is actually the whole point. Unlike tank tablets that sit in your tank 24/7 and slowly eat away at rubber seals and flappers, TrueClean never touches your tank components. The treated water bypasses the tank entirely and flows directly into the bowl only when you flush. Licensed plumbers literally recommend it. Your plumbing is safer with it than without it.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does it smell like bleach? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">No bleach at all. TrueClean uses naturally derived ingredients with a light lemongrass oil scent - think "freshly cleaned bathroom" rather than "hotel pool." Most customers say it's barely noticeable. Many actually love it because it's a subtle reminder that your bowl is actively being cleaned. No harsh fumes, no burning eyes, no need to open a window.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Will it fit my toilet? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Works with about 95% of standard toilets made in the last 30 years. It clips to your fill valve's refill tube - takes 60 seconds flat, no tools needed. If you've got a non-standard setup (some Kohler canister-style valves, for example), check our compatibility guide. And if it doesn't fit? Full refund, we even cover return shipping. Zero risk.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How often do I replace the cartridge? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">The dispenser itself is built to last you years - it's a one-time install. The cleaning cartridge lasts roughly 3 months with normal household use (about 15-20 flushes per day). Swapping it out takes 10 seconds - unscrew the old one, pop in the new one, done. No mess, no gloves needed.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What if it doesn't work for me? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Then you get every penny back. We offer a 90-day money-back guarantee - no hoops, no return needed, no awkward customer service calls. 200,000+ homes are already running these, so we're pretty confident. But if you're the exception? Full refund, zero drama.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I use it with a septic system? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Yep - totally septic-safe. The controlled cleaning dosage is well within safe limits for septic bacteria and won't harm your system. Your tank's ecosystem stays happy, your bowl stays sparkling.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does it clean old stains or just prevent new ones? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Both - and that's what makes it special. New buildup is prevented immediately from flush one. Existing hard water stains, mineral rings, and discoloration gradually break down over 1-2 weeks as the formula works its magic with every flush. For heavily stained bowls, we recommend doing one final deep clean before installing for the fastest transformation.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How is this different from tank tablets? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Night and day. Tank tablets sit in your tank water 24/7, constantly exposing your rubber flappers and seals to harsh chemicals. That leads to deterioration, leaks, and costly plumber visits ($300+ is common). Plus, that chemical water sits stagnant in your tank, filling small bathrooms with fumes. TrueClean's treated water bypasses the tank entirely and flows directly into the bowl only when you flush. All the cleaning power, none of the plumbing damage or health risks.</div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is it safe for kids and pets? <span class="chev">▼</span></summary>
        <div class="ans">Yes - TrueClean uses naturally derived ingredients with no bleach and no benzalkonium chloride. The formula is pet-safe at bowl dilution levels. A toilet bowl without any sanitizer is actually the riskier option - bacteria, viruses, and parasites can thrive in untreated bowl water. TrueClean keeps a safe, controlled amount of naturally derived cleaning agents working around the clock. That said, we always recommend keeping the lid closed as a general practice with little ones and furry friends around.</div>
